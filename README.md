Description
-----------

This is an interpreter for the language [Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) with a small twist: brainstorm's output operation prints only numbers (the numeric value of the memory cell). In other words, brainstorm is oriented toward complex computational problems.

How to Build
------------

Running the build.sh script in the respective directiory builds the executable, if you happen to have clang++-3.5.

Build Prerequisites
-------------------

clang++ 3.5. Or any other sane c++ compiler. But I prefer clang++-3.5.
